Log::Dispatch::File::Alerts - Object for logging to alert files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch::File::Alerts;

  my $file = Log::Dispatch::File::Alerts->new(
                             name      => 'file1',
                             min_level => 'emerg',
                             filename  => 'Somefile%d{yyyy!!!!}.log',
                             mode      => 'append' );

  $file->log( level => 'emerg',
              message => "I've fallen and I can't get up\n" );

=head1 ABSTRACT

This module provides an object for logging to files under the
Log::Dispatch::* system.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module subclasses Log::Dispatch::File for logging to date/time 
stamped files. See L<Log::Dispatch::File> for instructions on usage. 
This module differs only on the following three points:

=over 4

=item alert files

This module will use a seperate file for every log message.

=item multitasking-safe

This module uses flock() to lock the file while writing to it.

=item stamped filenames

This module supports a special tag in the filename that will expand to 
the current date/time/pid.

It is the same tag Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout uses, see 
L<Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout>, chapter "Fine-tune the date". 
In short: Include a "%d{...}" in the filename where "..." is a format 
string according to the SimpleDateFormat in the Java World 
(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). 
See also L<Log::Log4perl::DateFormat> for information about further 
restrictions.

In addition to the format provided by Log::Log4perl::DateFormat this 
module also supports '$' for inserting the PID and '!' for inserting a 
uniq number. Repeat the character to define how many character wide the 
field should be.

A note on the '!': The module first tries to find a fresh filename with this set 
to 1. If there is already a file with that name then it is increased until 
either a free filename has been found. If there is no free filename (e.g. you 
used '!!' and there are already 100 files) or the counter goes over the top 
(integer overflow) the module dies. So if you used many '!'s and there are many 
alert files, this can take quite a while. But if you have that many alert files, 
something already went very bad, so it should not really matter.

=head1 HISTORY

=over 8

=item 0.99

Original version; taken from Log::Dispatch::File::Rolling 1.02

=item 1.00

Initial coding

=item 1.01

Updated packaging for newer standards. No changes to the coding.

=item 1.02

Added unlocking of files we do not use.

Removed the 9999 files limit. Now it will create as many files as a Perl integer 
can support.

=item 1.03

Adapted to changes in Log::Dispatch::File. If you are useing Log::Dispatch::File
2.36 or earlier, use Alerts 1.02.
